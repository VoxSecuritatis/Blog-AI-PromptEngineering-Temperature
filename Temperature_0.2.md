## LLM Temperature Settings
Temperature setting = 0.2 (for ChatGPT, the default Temperature setting is 1.0) 

📌 Context

- Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate different styles of responses depending on the temperature setting. The temperature parameter adjusts the randomness of the output. Lower values make the responses more predictable, while higher values introduce more variety.
- This guide explains temperature using the 5W1H method (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) and provides examples and instructions.

🔹 5W1H Breakdown
|  Question      |	Explanation                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    What?       |   Temperature controls the randomness in model outputs. Low values produce deterministic results; high values produce creative results.            |
|    Who?        |   End users, developers, and professionals working with AI tools such as ChatGPT, Mistral, or Hugging Face models.                                 |
|    When?       |   Use low temperature for precision tasks (math, coding, compliance) and high temperature for brainstorming or creative writing.                   |
|    Where?      |   Temperature can be set in APIs, applications, and frameworks (e.g., temperature=0.7 in OpenAI, LangChain, or Streamlit).                         |
|    Why?        |   To align model responses with the intended purpose: factual consistency or creative variation.                                                   |
|    How?        |   Adjust the parameter within the range 0.0–2.0 and test the results.                                                                              |

|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|   0.0 – 0.2    |   Deterministic, consistent, factual                               |   Math, coding, compliance, Q&A                      |
|   0.3 – 0.7    |   Balanced with moderate variation                                 |   General writing, reports, moderate creativity      |
|   0.8 – 1.0    |   Creative and varied                                              |   Brainstorming, idea generation                     |
|   1.1 – 1.5    |   Very creative and analogy-driven                                 |   Storytelling, marketing content                    |
|      > 1.5     |   Chaotic and unpredictable                                        |   Experimental use only                              |

🔹 Step-by-Step: How to Use Temperature

1. Define your goal: precise or creative.
2. Set the temperature parameter, e.g., temperature=0.2 for accuracy, temperature=1.0 for balanced responses.
4. Run the same prompt at multiple settings.
5. Compare the outputs.

Select the setting that best matches your needs.

🔹 Example: Comparing Temperatures
## 🔹 Example: Comparing Temperatures

| **Prompt** | **0.2 Temperature (Deterministic)** | **0.7 Temperature (Balanced)** | **1.5 Temperature (Creative)** |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Explain what a firewall is** | A firewall is a system that monitors and filters network traffic based on predefined rules. | A firewall is like a digital gatekeeper, blocking suspicious traffic and allowing safe communication. | A firewall is a force field around a computer kingdom, choosing who may enter and keeping trolls away. |
| **Clean “dad” joke** | Why don’t skeletons fight each other? Because they don’t have the guts. | Why can’t you trust stairs? They’re always up to something. | I told my Wi-Fi we needed to talk. Now we’re not on the same wavelength, but my toaster still laughs at my jokes. |
| **Business value of AI** | The most important factor is aligning AI initiatives with business goals for measurable outcomes. | The key factor is linking AI to strategy for growth, savings, and better decision-making. | The most important factor is vision, using AI as a compass that reshapes value and creates new models. |

🔹 Key Takeaways

- Low temperature (0.2): Consistent and factual.
- Medium temperature (0.7): Balanced and flexible.
- High temperature (1.5): Creative and less predictable.

Always select the temperature that matches the task requirements.

✅ Using the temperature parameter allows you to control whether an AI model provides precise answers, balanced conversation, or imaginative exploration.

In a new prompt:  `set temperature=0.2 for the remainder of this chat. acknowledge.`
